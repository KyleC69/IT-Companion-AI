This repo is building a semantic model database for monitoring live changes to the Semantic Kernel API.
The intention is to have a github-like commit system for monitoring API surface changes.

- Prioritize performance and security in all implementations.

- When handling sensitive data, ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.

- When generating configuration files, ensure they follow the correct syntax and conventions for the respective formats.

- When writing unit tests, use MSTest and cover edge cases as well as typical use cases and expected fail/pass scenarios.

- DO NOT CHANGE VERSIONS OF DEPENDENCIES unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

- DO NOT ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

- DO NOT MODIFY THE STRUCTURE OF THE REPOSITORY unless explicitly instructed otherwise.

“When generating tests, treat failure as a valid and expected outcome.
A test is successful if it confirms the system throws the correct exception, rejects invalid input, or fails fast when state is inconsistent.
Always include:
– happy‑path tests
– failure‑path tests
– boundary tests
– invalid state tests
– null/empty/malformed input tests
– tests that intentionally trigger exceptions
Use direct method calls, not reflection helpers unless specifically required.
A test that asserts an exception is a successful test.”
