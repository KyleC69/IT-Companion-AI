This repo contains an Agentic AI ecosystem specializing in IT operations and Windows Configuration analysis system. It features a reasoning model (PHI4-Instruct-Onnx) for planning and orchestration of smaller models and targeted tooling.

- DO NOT stub any implementations. Always provide full implementations unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- When generating code, ensure it is functional and adheres to best practices in C# development.
- When creating classes or methods, include XML documentation comments for public members.
- Prioritize performance and security in all implementations.
- When handling sensitive data, ensure compliance with relevant data protection regulations.
- When generating configuration files, ensure they follow the correct syntax and conventions for the respective formats.
- When writing unit tests, use MSTest and cover edge cases as well as typical use cases and expected fail/pass scenarios.

- DO NOT CHANGE VERSIONS OF DEPENDENCIES unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- DO NOT ADD NEW DEPENDENCIES unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- DO NOT MODIFY THE STRUCTURE OF THE REPOSITORY unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- DO NOT DELETE FILES OR CODE unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- DO NOT MODIFY THIS INSTRUCTION FILE unless explicitly instructed otherwise.
- DO NOT DELETE OR MODIFY COMMENTS IN THE CODE unless explicitly instructed otherwise.


“When generating tests, treat failure as a valid and expected outcome.
A test is successful if it confirms the system throws the correct exception, rejects invalid input, or fails fast when state is inconsistent.
Always include:
– happy‑path tests
– failure‑path tests
– boundary tests
– invalid state tests
– null/empty/malformed input tests
– tests that intentionally trigger exceptions
Use direct method calls, not reflection helpers unless specifically required.
A test that asserts an exception is a successful test.”
