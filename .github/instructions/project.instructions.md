### This project is a multi model agentic AI set in the Semantic Kernel. It is going to be put into an application as an IT managers assistant monitoring systems state for anomalous settings or indicators. The AI will consist of several models, at least 2 larger models (Phi4) for chat and for orchestration and also smaller models handling smaller tasks. The models will have control of their own specific RAG tables of their specialties.

### 

### Specialties may include but not limited to network stack monitor, File system

### 

### There may be many smaller models each with specific RAG repositories for their specific specialty. RAG and Agent memory is to be contained in a PostgreSQL database for ease of retrieval and storage.. 

### 

### The Microsoft repo for Semantic Kernel is undergoing rapid development and it is imperative that you ensure you are using the newest API surface namespaces.

### 

### When making any kind of code changes DO NOT remove or alter the intended functionality
